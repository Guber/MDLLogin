MDLLogin is a very simple login page with a username and password form with plain js validation. It uses frontend framework MDL. And every time you refresh it, it has a different background image and a snackbar message. :)

It could be useful when you quickly need an easy on eye login page. If you wish to use it you could add extra images to /img folder, and change the randomImage.js and randomMessage.js files to add your images or files.

Here is a link for the [demo](https://int-rev.com/demo/login/login.html)
